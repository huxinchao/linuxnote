1:Memory

1.1 Memory Address
----- ----- -----
Logical Address (segment, offset)
Linear Address (Virtual address)
Physical Address(CPU --[bus addr]--> mem)

Logical Address ->[ Segment Part] -> Linear Address -> [Page Part] --> Logical Address

in the mutli cpu's computer, will have a 'Memory Arbiter' in between bus and memory's core
in the single cpu's computer, because of DMA, it also need 'Memory Arbiter'

[Segment Part] have 'Real Mode' and 'Protected Mode' (usually 'Protected Mode')

----- ----- ----- 

'Segment Part' have to part : Segment Selector and offset
Segement Selector's organization: [15-Index-3][2-Table Indicator-2][1-Request Privilege Level-0]

RPL = Current Privilege Level ;; 0 -> 3 High->Low

Segement Descriptor

Segment Descriptor in GDT(Global Descriptor Table) or LDT(Local Descriptor Table)
usually only define a GDT, but every process if need itself's segment, it will create a GDT.
GDT's location and size storaged in [GDTR Control Register]
LDT's location and size storaged in [LDTR Control Register]
